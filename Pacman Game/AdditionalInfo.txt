How the program is launched: 
	The user opens the jar file labeled "Pacman game", which will open the home screen to the game. The 
	home screen will show the user the title of the game, as well as three drop box features and five buttons
	for the user to use. The three drop boxes allow the user to choose which character they want to play with, 
	which level they want to play on, and what the background of their game can be, which is also considered
	the location where they will be playing in. Once the user chooses their preferences, the game will display
	what they have chosen before starting the game. This is all done by the classes "HomeScreen", "TextPicture", 
	and "Picture". The five buttons allow the user to perform different actions on the home screen. 
	
	The "start" button will create a separate screen where the game will be played, and will show the user how 
	many lives they have, how much time they have throughout the game, and what their score is as they play. They 
	will also see how many ghosts they are against, where the orbs are, and where the blocks of the maze are. In 
	the game, for every time they earn a score of 50, the user will receive a temporary power up which will allow
	the user to move faster in the maze, before it disappears. This is all done using the classes "ImagePicture",
	"Character", "Player", "GameUI", and "PacmanGame". 
	
	The "Help" button will create a separate screen which will give the user instructions on how to play the game, 
	and how to use the leaderboard when the user is completed the game and wish to see their rank in the game, and 
	can be closed by using the "go back" button on the bottom of the screen, which will then return them to the home
	screen. This is done using the class "HelpScreen" and "TextPicture". 
	
	The "Leaderboard" button will create a separate screen that shows the user the top three players in the game, and
	shows the user their name, score, the difficulty level they had done it on, and the time it took for them to reach
	that rank, along with its own series of buttons. The "Go back" button allows the user to close the screen and
	go back to the home screen. The "save file" button allows the user to download the entire leaderboard of the 
	top 30 players in the game. The "show all" button allows the user to see the entire top 30 players from the game.
	The "search leaderboard" button allows the user to search the name of the player they want to see if they can not
	find them in the ranks. This is done by "LeaderboardList", "LeaderboardRecord", "LeaderboardUI". 
	
	The "upload leaderboard" button will allow the user to upload the leaderboard file into the leaderboard screen so 
	that the user can play with to either beat their old score or beat another player's score. This is done with the 
	class "FileAccess". 
	
	The "exit" button will allow the user to shut down the entire program including any other separate screens open in
	the game. This is done by the class "HomeScreen". 
	
	
Bugs/problems that still exist in the game:
	- For the leaderboard class, when the ranks are shown, the names become rotated and causes the first name to move 
	to third place, the second name to move to first place, and the third name to move to second place. This bug was
	attempted to be fixed, but was unable to be fixed in the end.
